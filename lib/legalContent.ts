1. Terms of Service (TOS) and User Agreement
Title: Velgo Nigeria Platform User Agreement - The Binding Contract

1.1 Velgo’s Limited Role and Scope of Service
This Agreement is a legally binding contract between you (the "User," including both Clients and Workers) and Velgo Nigeria. By accessing or using the platform, you fully agree to these terms. Velgo operates solely as an introductory and verification service. Our core function is to facilitate the discovery and booking of local services by providing a trusted platform for matching Clients with subscribing Workers. Velgo is not an employer, contractor, or payment agent. We do not control the methods, materials, or hours of work performed by the Worker, who remains an independent service provider.

1.2 The Two-Sided Subscription and Monetization Mandate
Velgo’s business model is sustained entirely by Access Subscription Fees paid by both Clients and Workers, in accordance with the selected tier (Basic, Lite, Standard, Pro, Enterprise).
- Non-Refundable Fee: All subscription fees are paid monthly in advance and are strictly non-refundable, regardless of usage (number of jobs posted or accepted).
- Enforcement: Access is gated by the subscription tier. Any attempt by a Basic, Lite, Standard, or Pro User to exceed their Job Limit (posted or accepted) will result in an application-level block requiring immediate upgrade.
- Billing and Renewal: Subscriptions are auto-renewing. Users are responsible for ensuring sufficient funds are available to avoid service interruption and automatic demotion to the Basic tier upon failure of renewal.

1.3 Direct Payment Protocol and Total Exclusion of Liability (CRITICAL)
This section defines the financial relationship and Velgo’s complete disassociation from it.
- Mandate: All payments for services rendered must be made 100% directly by the Client to the Worker's verified bank account AFTER the service is fully completed and confirmed by the Client in the App.
- No Fiduciary Duty: Velgo is NOT a Payment Service Provider (PSP) or a financial intermediary. We do not hold Client funds in escrow, nor do we process, split, or guarantee any payment.
- Client Responsibility: The Client accepts full responsibility for the timely and accurate transfer of the agreed fee.
- Worker Risk: The Worker acknowledges that they bear the full risk of non-payment or delayed payment by the Client and agrees that their recourse is against the Client, not Velgo.
- Limited Recourse: Velgo will only intervene in non-payment disputes to provide communication logs and contact information as permissible by law, but WILL NOT refund or pay the service fee on behalf of the Client.

1.4 Account Termination and Suspension
Velgo reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate any account without notice if a user is found to be in breach of these terms, including, but not limited to: repeated non-payment (Client), repeated poor service/fraudulent claims (Worker), or attempts to circumvent the subscription/payment protocols.

2. Privacy Policy
Title: Velgo Nigeria Data Security and Your Privacy Rights

2.1 Data Collection and Legal Basis
We collect data to execute the core function of the platform: matching, verification, and service delivery. Our legal basis for processing data is primarily Contractual Necessity (to provide the service you signed up for) and Legitimate Interest (to ensure platform security and prevent fraud).
- Identity and Verification Data: Full Name, Phone Number, Email, Physical Address. This data is used for profile verification only.
- Financial Data (Display Only): Workers' Bank Account Name, Number, and Bank Name. This data is stored securely and is only displayed to the Client on the payment reminder screen. We do not collect or store any bank passwords or card security codes (CVVs).
- Geolocation Data: Collected only during an active booking to monitor Worker proximity to the job site. This data is not tracked in the background.

2.2 Data Sharing and Third Parties
- Worker-Client Visibility: Once a job is accepted, the Worker's and the Client's phone number are shared with the other party to facilitate the service.
- Payment Gateways: Subscription payments are processed via a secured Nigerian payment aggregator (Paystack). Your payment information is handled by them, not stored by Velgo.
- Legal Compliance: We will disclose data only when legally required by a court order, regulatory mandate, or to protect the rights and safety of Velgo, our users, or the general public.

2.3 Data Retention
We retain personal data as long as your account is active and for a mandatory minimum period of three (3) years after account termination to comply with Nigerian regulatory requirements concerning financial transactions and dispute resolution records. You may request deletion of your account, but core transactional records will be anonymized, not permanently erased.

3. Worker Guidelines and Safety Protocols
Title: Professional Standards, Safety, and Service Delivery Mandate

3.1 Professionalism and Code of Conduct
1. Truth in Advertising: Workers must only select categories and subcategories on their profile for which they hold the proven skill, certification (in Professional Services), or expertise. Misrepresentation is grounds for immediate termination.
2. Punctuality and Communication: Workers must adhere strictly to agreed-upon deadlines and communication protocols. Non-response to job requests(direct bookings) within 8 hours may lead to automatic cancellation and a profile warning.
3. No Offline Solicitation: Workers are strictly prohibited from soliciting Clients to book future services outside of the Velgo platform while their subscription is active. All recurring bookings must be facilitated through the App.

3.2 Payment Protocol Strict Compliance
1. Completion First: Payment must never be requested or accepted before the service is fully rendered and the Client confirms completion in the app.
2. Registered Details Only: Workers must instruct Clients to pay only to the bank details registered and displayed on the Client's payment reminder screen. Any attempt to use alternate bank accounts is a violation of policy.

3.3 Safety Protocols in Nigeria
1. Verification Check: Workers must always verify the Client's identity and job location before commencing work, especially in unfamiliar areas. If a location or client seems suspicious, the Worker should use the "Flag Safety Concern" feature in the App before proceeding.
2. Emergency Contact: Workers should set up an Emergency Contact number in their profile settings. Velgo's support team can attempt to contact this individual if the "Emergency" support button is activated during a job.
3. Discretion: Workers should avoid bringing expensive equipment or valuable personal items that are not essential to the job, especially in residential environments.

4. Disclaimers and Limited Liability
Title: Limitations of Service and Risk Acceptance

1. No Guarantee of Income or Jobs: Velgo provides access to the marketplace for a fee, but DOES NOT guarantee any specific volume of job requests or level of income for Workers.
2. Service Quality and Outcome: Velgo does not guarantee the quality, suitability, or outcome of the service rendered. The legal and operational contract for the work is solely between the Client and the Worker.
3. Financial Risk Acceptance: Clients and Workers explicitly agree to bear the full risk of the direct payment model, including the risk of non-payment, payment delays, or payment disputes. The User indemnifies Velgo Nigeria against any claim for financial loss arising from the Client-to-Worker transfer.
4. Jurisdiction: These terms and all disputes arising from them shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and any legal action shall be pursued in the courts of Edo State.
